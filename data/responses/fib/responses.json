When applied recursively, it continues this pattern, e.g. x_{n+3} := x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + (x_n + x_{n+1}). You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output.

            "prompt": "[Instructions]\nThe fibonacci function takes two inputs x_n and x_{n+1} and outputs x_{n+2}, where x_{n+2} := x_n + x_{n+1}. When applied recursively, it continues this pattern, e.g. x_{n+3} := x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + (x_n + x_{n+1}). You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output. Any FIB calls will be replaced downstream by d recursive calls to a fibbonaci function tool given starting inputs of a and b.\nAfter the [Answer] tag, you may only respond with your final answer, which can be either the final number or a tool call.

When applied recursively, it continues this pattern, e.g. x_{n+3} := x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + (x_n + x_{n+1}). You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output. Any FIB calls will be replaced downstream by d recursive calls to a fibbonaci function tool given starting inputs of a and b.\nAfter the [Answer] tag, you may only respond with your final answer, which can be either the final number or a tool call.

When applied recursively, it continues this pattern, e.g. x_{n+3} := x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + (x_n + x_{n+1}). You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output.

You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output.

            "prompt": "[Instructions]\nThe fibonacci function takes two inputs x_n and x_{n+1} and outputs x_{n+2}, where x_{n+2} := x_n + x_{n+1}. When applied recursively, it continues this pattern, e.g. x_{n+3} := x_{n+1} + x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + (x_n + x_{n+1}). You will need to know this function to solve these problems.\nWe introduce the FIB tool. To use it, put \\{FIB(a,b,d)\\} anywhere in your output. Any FIB calls will be replaced downstream by d recursive calls to a fibbonaci function tool given starting inputs of a and b.\nAfter the [Answer] tag, you may only respond with your final answer, which can be either the final number or a tool call. The [Answer] tag must precede the final answer.\nProblem to solve:\n\n[Question]\nWhat is the result of applying the fibonacci function starting from input 54 and 10 recursively 2 times?
